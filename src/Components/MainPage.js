				This is a mathematics game. If you are a math geek and love to solve puzzles, you have landed
				to the paradise.<br /><hr />
				Two things that will matter most in this game<br />
				1. <b>Speed</b><br/>
				2. <b>Accuracy</b><br /><br/>

				If the ratio of total point to number of levels is more than 250 in this game, dude you are
				genius :D <br /><br/>

				You can reach me at <b>ab1hi2shek@gmail.com</b>

				Anyway, <b>Enter your name</b> and get started. May the score be with you :p
